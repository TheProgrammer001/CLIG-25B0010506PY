CLIG-25B0010506PY â€” Command-Line Interactive Blackjack Game

This Python script implements a command-line Blackjack (21) game where a player
competes against the dealer. The player can hit (draw a card) or stand (stop drawing),
and the dealer follows standard Blackjack rules to draw cards until reaching at least 17 points.

Features:
- Visual card display using ASCII art and colored output via the chromafy module.
- Real-time keyboard input handling for 'hit', 'stand', 'play', 'help', and 'quit'.
- Accurate point calculation including proper handling of Aces (counting as 1 or 11).
- Simple game loop with clear user prompts and results.

Usage:
    Run the script directly:
        python blackjack.py

    Controls during the game:
        - Press 'H' to hit (draw a new card).
        - Press 'S' to stand (end your turn).
        - Press 'P' from the main menu to play a new game.
        - Press 'H' from the main menu to display instructions.
        - Press 'Q' from the main menu to quit the program.

Dependencies:
- Python standard libraries: time, random
- External modules: chromafy, keyboard, cards (make sure these are installed or available)

Welcome to Blackjack!

How to Play:
- The goal is to get your cards' points as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting).
- Number cards count as their number value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) count as 10 points.
- Aces can count as either 1 or 11 points, whichever helps you more.

Gameplay:
1. You and the dealer both get two cards initially.
2. One of the dealer's cards is shown; the other is hidden.
3. You can choose to 'Hit' (draw another card) or 'Stand' (end your turn).
4. If your total points go over 21, you bust and lose immediately.
5. After you stand, the dealer reveals their hidden card.
6. The dealer will draw cards until their total points are at least 17.
7. The winner is the one with points closest to 21 without going over.
8. If both have the same points, it's a tie.

Controls:
- Press 'H' to Hit (draw a new card).
- Press 'S' to Stand (end your turn).
- Press 'P' from the main menu to Play a new game.
- Press 'H' from the main menu to view these instructions.
- Press 'Q' to Quit the game.

Good luck and have fun!
